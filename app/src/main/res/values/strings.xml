        Khasi is a member of the Khasic group of Austro-Asiatic languages. It is spoken mainly in Meghalaya state in the north-east of India, and also in neighbouring parts of Assam and Bangladesh. There are about 1.6 million speakers of Khasi in India, according to the 2001 census. Khasi was recognised as an "associate offical language" of Meghalaya in 2005. There are a number of dialects of Khasi, including Sohra, Khynriam and War, which are more or less mutually intelligible, and Bhoi and Nonglung, which are different enough to be considered distinct languages.
        Khasi was first written with the Bengali alphabet by William Carey, a British missionary, in the early 19th century. Many Khasi books were written in the Assamese script, and Khasi was first written with the Latin alphabet by Thomas Jones, a Welsh missionary, in 1841.
